				This is the manual for 🏫&nbsp;Portal, an app built for independent
				learners.
			</p>
			<p>
				This document assumes that the reader is capable of understanding
				English language text and has basic computer literacy.
			</p>
			<p>🚧 Portal is a work in progress. Please report any issues you find.</p>

				<h2 id="adding-resources">📥 Adding Resources</h2>
				<p>
					In order to use the Portal app, you will need content to view within
					it. Inside the app, content is referred to as resources.
				</p>
				<p>
					The app can display two different types of resources: 📚&nbsp;Courses
					and 🗺️&nbsp;Course&nbsp;Maps.
				</p>
				<p>
					📚&nbsp;Courses are a collection of textbooks. Textbooks can be
					📕&nbsp;completable, where you can track your progress, or they can be
					📒&nbsp;non-completable. Non-completable textbooks are typically
					included as reference materials or supplemental reading.
				</p>
				<p>
					🗺️&nbsp;Course&nbsp;Maps are an interactive tree of 📚&nbsp;Courses.
					These help you plan your learning journey by providing an intended
					order for completing courses.
				</p>
				<h3>🌐 Finding Resources</h3>
				<p>
					The developers who build Portal do not create resources. Instead, they
					intend for Portal users to build communities for creating and sharing
					resources.
				</p>
				<p>
					To help new users, major online communities and collections built
					around Portal are included on Portal's website. This website can be
					found in ⚙️&nbsp;Settings, under the 🌐&nbsp;Useful&nbsp;Websites
					drop-down.
				</p>
				<h3>📂 Importing Resources</h3>
				<p>
					Resources are distributed as <code>.zip</code> files. These files
					contain one or more 📚&nbsp;Courses and may contain
					🗺️&nbsp;Course&nbsp;Maps.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to import a resource, open the &nbsp;Course&nbsp;Navigator,
					and click the 📂&nbsp;Open&nbsp;Resource&nbsp;Folder button. Then,
					drag the <code>.zip</code> files into the resource folder. Once you
					have added the files into the folder, click the
					🔄&nbsp;Refresh&nbsp;Navigator button to update the app's list of
					resources.
				</p>
				<p>⚠ You should only import resources from creators you trust.</p>

				<h2 id="taking-courses">📚 Taking Courses</h2>
				<h3> Planning Your Journey</h3>
				<p>
					In order to take a 📚&nbsp;Course, you will need to add it to your
					&nbsp;Active&nbsp;Courses. This is done using the
					&nbsp;Course&nbsp;Navigator.
				</p>
				<p>
					The &nbsp;Course&nbsp;Navigator displays all 📚&nbsp;Courses and
					🗺️&nbsp;Course&nbsp;Maps imported into the app. You can click on
					listed resources to view their details, and you can use the checkboxes
					to add or remove items from your &nbsp;Active&nbsp;Courses.
				</p>
				<p>
					When viewing completable 📚&nbsp;Courses, tools will be available to
					mark the course as complete, or clear all progress made within it.
					These can be used to avoid retaking courses where you already know the
					material, or to retake a course you previously completed.
				</p>
				<p>
					When available, 🗺️&nbsp;Course&nbsp;Maps can be useful for planning
					your studying. They display an intended order to complete
					📚&nbsp;Courses in, along with a brief overview of course completion.
					You can click on a 📚&nbsp;Course displayed within a
					🗺️&nbsp;Course&nbsp;Map to view it's details.
				</p>
				<h3>📖 Studying</h3>
				<p>
					On the 🏫&nbsp;Home page, you can find your
					&nbsp;Active&nbsp;Courses. Each listed 📚&nbsp;Course contains
					textbooks (📕 or 📒), which can be clicked on to open the
					📖&nbsp;Textbook&nbsp;Viewer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Inside the 📖&nbsp;Textbook&nbsp;Viewer, you can click on sections to
					view them, and use the checkboxes to mark sections as completed. Time
					spent within the viewer is shown on the ⏱️&nbsp;stopwatch.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ⏱️&nbsp;stopwatch display contains multiple squares. Once all of
					the squares become dark green, your goal has been reached for that
					📚&nbsp;Course. The stopwatch resets daily.
				</p>
				<h3>🗓 Monitoring Progress</h3>
				<p>
					On the 🏫&nbsp;Home page, you can find your &nbsp;Active&nbsp;Courses
					and 🗓&nbsp;Progress.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each 📚&nbsp;Course contains a list of textbooks. Within each
					📕&nbsp;completable&nbsp;textbook, multiple squares are displayed,
					with each square representing a chapter. Once all of the squares
					become dark red, the textbook has been completed.
				</p>
				<p>
					The 🗓&nbsp;Progress section displays overall
					⌛️&nbsp;Studying&nbsp;Time and 📑&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;Completion in a
					multi-week view, with each square representing one day. The outlined
					square represents the current day, and the intensity of each square's
					color represents the progress made on that day.
				</p>
				<p>
					These tools can help provide useful encouragement by making progress
					visible. You can adjust your goals to better fit your needs in
					⚙️&nbsp;Settings.
				</p>

				<h2 id="troubleshooting">🧰 Troubleshooting</h2>
				<h3>🛑 Understanding Errors</h3>
				<p>Errors can happen for a wide variety of reasons:</p>
				<p>
					🐞&nbsp;Application&nbsp;Errors are issues which are caused by
					unexpected behavior in the app. Please
					<a href="#reporting-issues">report these errors</a> if you encounter
					them.
				</p>
				<p>
					💽&nbsp;Disk&nbsp;Errors are issues which prevent the app from reading
					user data from the computer's disk. These are rare and have a wide
					range of potential causes.
				</p>
				<p>
					📄&nbsp;Resource&nbsp;Errors are non-database issues that prevent
					resources from being loaded.
				</p>
				<p>
					🗃&nbsp;Database&nbsp;Errors are issues with the app's internal
					database. The internal database keeps track of user settings and
					progress data.
				</p>
				<p>All possible error messages are listed below:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						🐞 Application Errors
						<ul>
							<li>"An internal error occured"</li>
							<li>"Unable to perform API call"</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						💽 Disk Errors
						<ul>
							<li>"Unable to create resource folder"</li>
							<li>"Unable to write resource schema"</li>
							<li>"Unable to check if Course exists"</li>
							<li>"Unable to get Course and CourseMap list"</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						📄 Resource Errors
						<ul>
							<li>"Unable to get Course"</li>
							<li>"Unable to get Course Map"</li>
							<li>"Unable to display Course"</li>
							<li>"Unable to display Course Map"</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						🗃 Database Errors
						<ul>
							<li>"Unable to load application database"</li>
							<li>"Unable to get list of active Courses"</li>
							<li>"Unable to update list of active Courses"</li>
							<li>"Unable to get progress for Course"</li>
							<li>"Unable to update progress for Course"</li>
							<li>"Unable to get overall progress"</li>
							<li>"Unable to get Settings"</li>
							<li>"Unable to update Settings"</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>ℹ Not all issues will cause an error message to be displayed.</p>
				<p>
					ℹ If the application refuses to open, this is an
					🐞&nbsp;Application&nbsp;Error.
				</p>
				<h3>🛠️ Fixing Common Issues</h3>
				<p>
					In the absence of 💽&nbsp;Disk&nbsp;Errors,
					📄&nbsp;Resource&nbsp;Errors are caused by resources which are
					incompatible with the app. They can be fixed by removing the
					problematic resource from the 📂&nbsp;Resource&nbsp;Folder.
				</p>
				<p>
					Issues with 📚&nbsp;Courses are either a result of a course which is
					corrupted, or a course which is not compatible with the active
					application version. If updating Portal does not fix the issue,
					contact the resource creator.
				</p>
				<p>
					Issues with 🗺️&nbsp;Course&nbsp;Maps can result from a course map
					which is corrupted, not compatible with the active application
					version, or missing courses.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the error message is "Unable to display Course Map", then the
					course map is missing one or more of the courses it is designed to
					accompany. Contact the resource creator for more information.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the error message is "Unable to get Course Map", the course map is
					either corrupted or not compatible with the active application
					version. If updating Portal does not fix the issue, contact the
					resource creator.
				</p>
				<p>
					🗃&nbsp;Database&nbsp;Errors are rare. In the absence of
					💽&nbsp;Disk&nbsp;Errors, these result from an issue with the app's
					internal database.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the error message is "Unable to get Settings", try using the
					⚙️&nbsp;Reset&nbsp;Settings&nbsp;to&nbsp;Defaults action under the
					error page's 🛠️&nbsp;Database&nbsp;Actions drop-down.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the error message is "Unable to get list of active Courses", try
					using the 📚&nbsp;Reset&nbsp;Active&nbsp;Courses action under the
					error page's 🛠️&nbsp;Database&nbsp;Actions drop-down.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a last resort, the app's database can be entirely reset. However,
					this will
					<strong>permanently erase all user settings and progress data</strong
					>. To reset the database, open the 📂&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Folder using the
					action on the error page, and delete the folder with the name
					"Internal Database". Once the folder has been deleted, close and
					re-open the app.
				</p>
				<h3 id="reporting-issues">🐞 Reporting Issues</h3>
				<p>
					Once you have confirmed that an issue is caused by a mistake in the
					app, rather than a mistake in one of your resources, you should report
					it. This allows the developers who build the app to know that the
					issue exists, so that they can fix it.
				</p>
				<p>
					ℹ If you are having an issue with a specific resource, you should
					contact the creators of that resource instead.
				</p>
				<p>
					In ⚙️&nbsp;Settings, you can find the 🐞&nbsp;Issue&nbsp;Tracker under
					the 🌐&nbsp;Useful&nbsp;Websites drop down. If you are on an error
					page, you can click on the 🔗&nbsp;App&nbsp;Issue&nbsp;Tracker link.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before filing an issue, you should check that someone else has not
					already filed an report of that same issue. Use the search to find
					existing issues which may be similar.
				</p>
				<p>
					If an report does not already exist, click the "New issue" button and
					fill out the provided template. An app developer will review your
					issue shortly.
				</p>

			<section>
				<h2 id="creating-resources"> Creator's Guide</h2>
				<p>
					⚠ It is highly recommended that you read all preceding sections of
					the manual before reading this section.
				</p>
				<p>
					This guide is intended for those who would like to create resources
					for Portal. Unlike using existing resources, creating resources
					requires some technical knowledge.
				</p>
				<p>You will need a basic understanding of the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Tom's Obvious Minimal Language (TOML)</li>
					<li>Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)</li>
					<li>JSON Schema</li>
					<li>Extensible Markup Language (XML)</li>
					<li>Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML)</li>
					<li>
						EPUB 3 specification
						<ul>
							<li>OCF abstract container</li>
							<li>EPUB navigation document</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>ZIP archive format</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You will need the following digital tools:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A file archiver, such as PeaZip</li>
					<li>
						A code editor, such as Visual Studio Code
						<ul>
							<li>
								A plugin to validate TOML files against a JSON schema
								(recommended)
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>A specialized ePub editor, such as Sigil (recommended)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Throughout the rest of this section, Portal's user data folder will be
					referred to as <code>$APPDATA</code>. Paths are case-sensitive
					(assuming the underlying filesystem is) unless otherwise specified.
				</p>
				<p>
					ℹ When using UUIDs in filesystem paths, the UUID must be represented
					in lowercase hexadecimal form, without separators (example:
					<code>79a55c4e046343039424684764eccd8a</code>). When referring to
					representations of UUIDs in filesystem paths, the syntax
					<code>{UUID}</code> will be used.
				</p>
				<h3> Resource Schema</h3>
				<p>
					Portal preserves backwards-compatibility for documented behavior.
					Updating Portal should not break existing resources — if this happens,
					it's a bug. However, resources designed for newer versions of Portal
					may fail to load on older versions.
				</p>
				<p>
					In some cases, it may be preferable to use specific versions of Portal
					for building resources. Portal automatically generates a folder
					containing JSON schema upon startup, located at
					<code>$APPDATA/Resource Schema/</code>. This schema documents the
					structure and functionality of resource TOML files.
				</p>
				<p>
					This manual's text aims to avoid being tightly coupled to a specific
					app version, and will not repeat information that is within the scope
					of the relevant schema files.
				</p>
				<h3>📚 Courses</h3>
				<p>
					Courses are folders containing a TOML file named
					<code>course.toml</code> at their root. This file, adhering to the
					<code>$APPDATA/Resource Schema/Course.json</code> schema, contains a
					set of one or more textbooks (in EPUB format).
				</p>
				<p>
					All files or folders referenced by the <code>course.toml</code> must
					be contained within the Course folder. Files or folders within the
					Course folder which are not referenced by the index are ignored.
				</p>
				<p>
					Courses are loaded from the path
					<code>$APPDATA/User Resources/{UUID}/</code>. On the 🏫&nbsp;Home
					page, only active courses are loaded. In the
					📖&nbsp;Textbook&nbsp;Viewer, only the Course being viewed is loaded.
					In the &nbsp;Course&nbsp;Navigator, all Courses are loaded,
					regardless of their active status.
				</p>
				<h4>📕 Textbooks</h4>
				<p>
					ℹ This section assumes that you have an existing textbook, in EPUB
					format, that you would like to include in a Course. Converting
					textbooks into the EPUB format, or creating EPUB documents from
					scratch, is out of scope for this document.
				</p>
				<p>
					All textbooks referenced by the <code>course.toml</code> must be
					unpacked EPUB files (the EPUB container must be a folder, not a file).
					Existing EPUBs can be unpacked by changing their extension to
					<code>.zip</code> and then extracting the archive. Review the Course
					schema for a list of supported EPUB versions.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order for a textbook to be completable, a list of user-completable
					chapters must be included in the configuration for that textbook. Each
					referenced section in the chapter must match a valid
					<code>href</code> from the EPUB's Table of Contents.
				</p>
				<p>
					ℹ Only make chapters or sections completable when their completion is
					<em>meaningful</em>. Sections included for reference or as
					supplementary material should not be marked as completable.
				</p>
				<p>
					The 📖&nbsp;Textbook&nbsp;Viewer is the only part of the application
					which loads Course textbooks (all other areas of the app will only
					load the
					<code>course.toml</code>). It will only load the textbook being
					actively viewed.
				</p>
				<p>
					The &nbsp;Course&nbsp;Navigator is useful for checking the completion
					of a Course. Like the 🏫&nbsp;Home page, you can click on textbooks
					within a displayed 📚&nbsp;Course to open the
					📖&nbsp;Textbook&nbsp;Viewer.
				</p>
				<h3>🗺️ Course Maps</h3>
				<p>
					Course Maps are TOML files, adhering to the
					<code>$APPDATA/Resource Schema/CourseMap.json</code> schema, which
					contain a user-facing dependency tree of Courses (referenced by UUID).
				</p>
				<p>
					Course Maps are loaded from the path
					<code>$APPDATA/User Resources/{UUID}.toml</code> when using the
					&nbsp;Course&nbsp;Navigator. An invalid Course Map will result in an
					immediate error. However, a Course Map which references a non-existent
					Course will only produce an error once the user attempts to load the
					Course Map.
				</p>
				<h3> Packaging and Sharing Resources</h3>
				<p>
					⚠ You should
					<strong
						>always test all aspects of your resources in the Portal app</strong
					>
					before sharing them. Validating your resource against the relevant
					schema will not catch all possible mistakes.
				</p>
				<p>
					⚠ If you plan on publically distributing a Course, a basic
					understanding of copyright law is required. Legal guidance is out of
					scope for this document.
				</p>
				<p>
					Resources are packaged as unencrypted ZIP archives, which are loaded
					from the path
					<code>$APPDATA/User Resources/*.zip</code> (extension is not case
					sensitive). The Portal app automatically extracts the contents of all
					detected archives into <code>$APPDATA/User Resources/</code>,
					overwriting any files which already exist. Decompression will not be
					performed recursively, so archives should not be put inside other
					archives. Once the decompression process is successfully completed,
					the archive will be deleted from the folder.
				</p>
				<p>
					ℹ Unlike Courses or Course Maps, archive filenames do not convey
					information to the app. You should use these filenames to inform the
					<em>end user</em> of the archive's contents.
				</p>
				<p>
					ZIP archives can be uncompressed, or they can be compressed with any
					of the algorithms supported by the app: DEFLATE, DEFLATE64, BZIP2,
					ZStandard, LZMA, and XZ.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sets of Courses which are intended to be completed together should be
					packaged together into one archive. If this is not feasible, use
					multiple archives with filenames indicating their relation (example:
					<code>My Course Collection (Part 1 of 3).zip</code>). Courses and
					Course Maps should be distributed together, as one archive containing
					all relevant resources. Do not distribute Course Maps separately from
					Courses.
