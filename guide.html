			<h1>📜 Guide</h1>
			<p>
				This is the manual for 🏫&nbsp;Portal, an app built for independent
				learners.
			</p>
			<p>
				This document assumes that the reader is capable of understanding
				English language text and has basic computer literacy.

			<p>
				In order to use the Portal app, you will need content to view within it.
				Inside the app, content is referred to as resources.
			</p>
			<p>
				The app can display two different types of resources: 📚&nbsp;Courses
				and 🗺️&nbsp;Course&nbsp;Maps.
			</p>
			<p>
				📚&nbsp;Courses are a collection of textbooks. Textbooks can be
				📕&nbsp;completable, where you can track your progress, or they can be
				📒&nbsp;non-completable. Non-completable textbooks are typically
				included as reference materials or supplemental reading.
			</p>
			<p>
				🗺️&nbsp;Course&nbsp;Maps are an interactive tree of 📚&nbsp;Courses.
				These help you plan your learning journey by providing an intended order
				to complete courses in.
			</p>
			<h3>🌐 Finding Resources</h3>
			<h3>📂 Importing Resources</h3>
			<h2 id="creating-resources">🎨 Creating Resources</h2>
			<p>
				⚠ Unlke importing existing resources, creating resources for Portal is
				a more involved progress. A degree of specialized technical knowledge is
				required.
			</p>
			<p>You will need to understand the following concepts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>TOML configuration format</li>
				<li>Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)</li>
				<li>JSON schema</li>
				<li>
					EPUB e-Book format
					<ul>
						<li>Extensible Markup Language (XML)</li>
						<li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</li>
						<li>OCF abstract container (EPUB-specific file hierarchy)</li>
						<li>EPUB navigation document (EPUB v3)</li>
						<li>Navigation Center eXtended (EPUB v2)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>ZIP archive format</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				A code editor (such as Visual Studio Code) is strongly recommended,
				along with a tool or plugin to validate TOML files against a JSON
				schema.
			</p>
			<p>
				A specialized ePub editor (such as Sigil) is recommended. However, in a
				pinch, an ordinary code editor can be used instead.
