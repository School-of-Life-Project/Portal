			<h1>📜 Guide</h1>
			<p>
				This is the manual for 🏫&nbsp;Portal, an app built for independent
				learners.
			</p>
			<p>
				This document assumes that the reader is capable of understanding
				English language text and has basic computer literacy.
			</p>

			<p>
				In order to use the Portal app, you will need content to view within it.
				Inside the app, content is referred to as resources.
			</p>
			<p>
				The app can display two different types of resources: 📚&nbsp;Courses
				and 🗺️&nbsp;Course&nbsp;Maps.
			</p>
			<p>
				📚&nbsp;Courses are a collection of textbooks. Textbooks can be
				📕&nbsp;completable, where you can track your progress, or they can be
				📒&nbsp;non-completable. Non-completable textbooks are typically
				included as reference materials or supplemental reading.
			</p>
			<p>
				🗺️&nbsp;Course&nbsp;Maps are an interactive tree of 📚&nbsp;Courses.
				These help you plan your learning journey by providing an intended order
				to complete courses in.
			</p>
			<h3>🌐 Finding Resources</h3>
			<h3>📂 Importing Resources</h3>
			<h2 id="creating-resources">🎨 Creating Resources</h2>
			<p>
				 Unlike importing existing resources, creating resources for Portal is
				a more involved progress. A degree of specialized technical knowledge
				will be required.
			</p>
			<p>You will need a basic understanding of the following concepts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tom's Obvious Minimal Language (TOML)</li>
				<li>Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)</li>
				<li>JSON Schema</li>
				<li>
					EPUB e-Book format
					<ul>
						<li>EPUB v3.2 specification</li>
						<li>
							Open Publication Structure v2 specification (only used by EPUB v2
							documents)
						</li>
						<li>Extensible Markup Language (XML)</li>
						<li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</li>
						<li>OCF abstract container (EPUB-specific file hierarchy)</li>
						<li>EPUB navigation document</li>
						<li>Navigation Center eXtended (only used by EPUB v2 documents)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					ZIP archive format
					<ul>
						<li>DEFLATE compression algorithm</li>
						<li>LZMA compression algorithm</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You will need the following digital tools:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A file archiver, such as PeaZip</li>
				<li>
					A code editor, such as Visual Studio Code
					<ul>
						<li>
							A plugin to validate TOML files against a JSON schema
							(recommended)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>A specialized ePub editor, such as Sigil (recommended)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Throughout the rest of this section, Portal's user data folder will be
				referred to as <code>$APPDATA</code>.
			</p>
			<h3> Portal Schema</h3>
			<p>
				Portal preserves backwards-compatibility whenever possible. Updating
				Portal should not break existing resources — if this happens, it's a
				bug.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, Portal makes no guarantees regarding forwards-compatibility for
				resources. Resources designed for newer versions may fail to load on
				older versions.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result, it may be preferable to use specific versions of Portal for
				building resources. Portal automatically generates a folder containing
				JSON schema upon startup, located at
				<code>$APPDATA/Resource Schema/</code>. This schema documents the
				structure and functionality of resource TOML files.
			</p>
			<p>
				This manual aims to maintain a degree of both backwards and forwards
				compatibility, and will not repeat information that is within the scope
				of the relevant schema files.
