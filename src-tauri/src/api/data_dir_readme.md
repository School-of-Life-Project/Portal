# A short guide to managing your data

This folder contains all user data stored by the Portal application. All files
within this folder are designed to be user readable and modifiable.

However, modifying these files without knowledge of how to do so properly can
cause issues with the application. This guide aims to empower you to understand
how to manage your own data.

## What you will need

- A willingness to learn, and the courage to explore things outside of your comfort zone.

- An understanding of basic computer skills (such as how files, file extensions, and folders work).

- A plain-text editor, such as Notepad. Text editors with syntax-highlighting functionality, such as
	[Notepad++ (Windows Only)](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) or
	[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) are recommended but not required.

- A basic understanding of the following concepts:
	- How to read [Markdown (.md)](https://commonmark.org/help/) files, like this one
	- What the [ePub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) and [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) file formats are
	- How to use the [TOML Configuration Format (.toml)](https://toml.io)
	- What a [Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) is
