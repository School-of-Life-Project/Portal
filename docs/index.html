		<h1>🏫 Portal</h1>

		<p>Portal is an app built for independent learners.</p>
		<p>
			Unlike most eLearning applications, Portal is focused on making use of
			existing learning materials. Any textbook or set of textbooks can be
			converted into a Portal course, as long as it is available in the EPUB
			format.
		</p>
		<p>
			Portal is designed to perform well on low-end hardware and does not
			require an internet connection to use.
		</p>
